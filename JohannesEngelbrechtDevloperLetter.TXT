Additionally, I am knowledgeable in signal-processing and mathematical analysis with proficiency in web-system design and deployment.

Because my professional goals align with the project's success mission and values, this opportunity is especially exciting. I believe my collaboration, critical thinking and innovation abilities will support and drive your continued organizational success.

Sincerely,
